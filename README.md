# credit-card_processing-example

These are some examples files from a project where I was changing our payment processing
provider from Authorize.NET to Cybersource. I have removed some of the code not related to Cybersource for clarity. ProcessPayment.cs
is the consuming class, and Cybersource is the model for the credit card processing. Cybersource.cs uses a Cybersource library for 
building request and response objects.
